// JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that data types of variables are determined by the value they hold at runtime and can change throughout the program as we assign different values to them.

// Primitive

/*
7 types: String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, null, Symbol(used to make any value unique), BigInt.

    Number => number
    String  => string
    Boolean  => boolean
    null  => object
    undefined  =>  undefined
    Symbol  =>  symbol
    BigInt  =>  bigint
*/

// Reference (Non-Primitive) -- reference of address can be allocated in memory

/*
   Arrays  =>  object
   Function  =>  function
   Object  =>  object
*/

// Array, Objects, Functions.
